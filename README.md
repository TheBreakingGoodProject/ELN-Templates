# Welcome to the ELN template repository!

Electronic laboratory notebooks offer many advantages for researchers working in both industry and academia, including increased accessibility, version-control and improved data-sharing capacity. These traits make them particularly useful for collaborative projects in which researchers may be geographically distant but working closely with others.

Our aim is to encourage the use of GitHub as a real-time, open and accessible lab notebook and this repository complements our work on using GitHub as an electronic laboratory notebook. We have designed this template repository for any researcher to fork and adapt to their own work. Each tab; code, issues, discussions, projects and wiki, has a template embedded to get you started but that can be adapted to suit your style, preferences and needs. 

To get started fork this repository to your own GitHub. 

We'd love to hear about your own experiences in using GitHub as your electronic laboratory notebook - feel free to jump on to the [discussion board](https://github.com/TheBreakingGoodProject/ELN-Templates/discussions/2) to share your questions, tips and tricks or problems you've run into!
