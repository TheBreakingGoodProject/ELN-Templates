# Welcome to the ELN templates page!

Electronic laboratory notebooks offer many advantages for researchers working in both industry and academia, including increased accessibility, version-control and improved data-sharing capacity. These traits make them particularly useful for collaborative projects in which researchers may be geographically distant but working closely with others.

This repository complements our work on using GitHub as an electronic laboratory notebook. We have designed a template for any researcher to use and adapt to their own work. To access the template, simply navigate to the [Issues](https://github.com/TheBreakingGoodProject/ELN-Templates/issues) page.

Our aim is to encourage the use of GitHub as a real-time, open and accessible lab notebook. We'd love to hear about your own experiences with it - feel free to jump on a [discussion board](LINK) to share your questions, tips and tricks or problems you've run into!
